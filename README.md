# untitled game engine

This is a 2D game engine/framework made for typescript. Each game object (referred to as an `Instance` class) uses a parent-child relationship to allow for easy orginization of your game.
Each child applies a getter to its parent, letting you access children in a very simple way. There is also a `getChild()` method on each instance that takes in a path seperated by dots, if you want to use that.

Documentation outside of code will only be made once this project has had most features fully implemented.

For now, you can use the in-code documentation.
